                <h2>Simple Linked List</h2>
                <p>
                    In any single linked list, the individual element is called as "Node". Every "Node" contains two fields, data field, and the next field. The data field is used to store actual value of the node and next field is used to store the address of next node in the sequence.
                    Single linked list is a sequence of elements in which every element has link to its next element in the sequence.

                <h2>Double Linked List</h2>
                <p>
                    In a single linked list, every node has a link to its next node in the sequence. So, we can traverse from one node to another node only in one direction and we can not traverse back. We can solve this kind of problem by using a double linked list. A double linked list can be defined as follows...
                    Double linked list is a sequence of elements in which every element has links to its previous element and next element in the sequence.
                    In a double linked list, every node has a link to its previous node and next node. So, we can traverse forward by using the next field and can traverse backward by using the previous field. Every node in a double linked list contains three fields

                <h2>Circular Linked List</h2>
                <p>
                   In single linked list, every node points to its next node in the sequence and the last node points NULL. But in circular linked list, every node points to its next node in the sequence but the last node points to the first node in the list
                   A circular linked list is a sequence of elements in which every element has a link to its next element in the sequence and the last element has a link to the first element
                   That means circular linked list is similar to the single linked list except that the last node points to the first node in the list
